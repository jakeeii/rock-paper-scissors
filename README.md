# rock-paper-scissors

A simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game designed with Javascript. The goal of this 
project was to get comfortable with using Javascript and its syntax. This game
was originally designed to be run in the browser console only and did not 
display anything on the webpage itself. 

I have revisited this project and added a GUI to improve the playability and to
not depend on the console for output. Now, there are buttons to make a selection
instead of prompting the user for input. This version also displays a running
score in the top left of the page and announces who won once either player
achieves 5 points. The game can be reset by simply making a new selection.
