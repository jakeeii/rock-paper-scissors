# rock-paper-scissors

A simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game designed with Javascript. The goal of this 
project was to get comfortable with using Javascript and its syntax. This game
is designed to be run in the browser console only and does not display anything
on the webpage itself. Later, I will revisit this project to add Graphical
User Interface with buttons and text to make the game more interactive and 
improve playability.
